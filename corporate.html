	    <h3><strong>Context of Campaign and Promotional Activities</strong></h3>
	      <h4>Target audience: expats in their 20/30s who came to work and live in the Netherlands.</h4>
	      <h4>After conducting several interviews, we found out that the main problems our target group struggle with are: the organizational matters of moving to another country, cultural differences/language barrier and the feeling of loneliness/homesickness. Our interviews admitted that out of these problems the biggest issue is finding the accommodation and dealing with all the documents and organizational matters. They said that the process of becoming an expat might be overwhelming and they all felt at some point that ‘quitting’ on their goals is an easier option.</h4>
	      <h4>The purpose of our campaign is to spread a bold and confident mindset among new expats coming to the Netherlands. Our purpose as a brand is to push them to be persistent and act upon their goals even though it might be a struggle. After conducting research on which media channels our target group uses the most we decided to create an Instagram and Facebook page to promote our brand.</h4>
	      <h4>Our reach objectives:</h4> 
		    <ul>
			  <li>We want to increase brand awareness by creating and posting new content 2 times per week on each platform (Facebook, Instagram).</li> 
			  <li>We aim to reach at least 500 views on the Facebook fan page and on the Instagram page before April 10th, 2023.</li>
		    </ul>
	      <h4>Our response objectives:</h4>
		    <ul>
			  <li>We want to have at least 100 followers on Instagram by April 10th, 2023.</li>
		      <li>We want to have at least 100 likes on our Facebook page by April 10th, 2023.</li>
		      <li>We want to have at least 100 likes in total on our Instagram posts by April 10th, 2023.</li>
		      <li>We want to have at least 100 likes in total on our Facebook posts by April 10th, 2023.</li>
		    </ul>
	      <h4>Our affect objective:</h4> 
		    <ul>
			  <li>We want our audience to feel confident in accepting new challenges and embracing their fears by April 10th, 2023.</li>
		    </ul>
		
	    <h3><strong>Learning Points</strong></h3>
          <h4><u>What have we learned?</u></h4>
		    <ul>
		      <li>It is very challenging to promote a new brand without any budget</li>
			  <li>It was easier to reach your target audience via Instagram than Facebook as the first platform gives an opportunity to follow your potential clients which is not possible with Facebook</li>
			  <li>Number of views of video content has been higher compared to static posts</li>
		    </ul>
          <h4><u>What worked and what didn’t? What went as expected and what didn’t?</u></h4>
		    <ul>
		      <li>On Instagram we followed a lot of accounts that relate to the Netherlands and expat communities and some of them followed us back which was a success</li>
			  <li>On Instagram we prepared interactive content as quizes or open questions but we didn’t get any responses which was a fail</li>
			  <li>On Facebook we barely received any engagement</li>
		    </ul>
		
	    <h3><strong>Future Planning</strong></h3>
		  <h4><u>What would we do differently?</u></h4>
		    <ul>
			  <li>We would create a Facebook group, try to search for accounts of expats and invite them to join the group. We believe that the group would create a more integrated community and people would be more willing to engage with the content we post.</li>
			  <li>We would post every day on both Facebook and Instagram. As a new brand we realized that posting as much as possible is the best solution to spread awareness.</li>
			  <li>We would follow even more Instagram accounts of expats and try to connect with them by leaving a comment under their photos or sending a direct message.</li>
		    </ul>
		  <h4><u>What would we do if the campaign would continue?</u></h4>
		    <ul>
			  <li>We would apply the practices written above.</li>
			  <li>We would introduce our product in more detail and promote its advantages.</li>
			  <li>We would organize meetings that gather expats together where we offer informative workshops on living in the Netherlands. This type of event would help to promote our brand and gather more clients.</li>

	    <h3><strong>Lean Canvas</strong></h3>
		
		  <h4>Only after we had completed all necessary problem and solution interviews in order to more explicitly justify our consumers were we able to define the final edition of our Lean Canvas:</h4>
		  <h4>ADD picture!</h4>
	      <h4><u>Problem</u></h4>
		    <h4>After conducting the first round of interviews with our target group, a number of problems were raised, but three major issues kept coming up repeatedly. The first one was about finding accommodation. A big percentage of the interviewed people shared with us that they had a very hard time finding a place to live when they came to the Netherlands. The second major problem was related to organizational matters. The target group shared that it was hard to arrange all the documents they needed in order to live in the country because either the information provided was not in English or it was not well explained. The final major issue was adapting to the language and culture. After looking at all the problems, we chose to concentrate more on the difficulty of locating adequate housing but at the same time find solutions to all the problems.</h4>
		
	      <h4><u>Solution</u></h4>
		    <h4>After considering and taking a closer look at this problem, we concluded that a proper approach to deal with these problems is to help the expats find accommodation more easily and in addition provide help with administration manners when they arrive. By doing so, we hope to inspire confidence in our consumers that they can achieve anything, even if they are alone in a foreign country. How we want to solve this problem is by making a website where expats and internationals can rent temporarily a hotel room with discounted prices in all big cities in the Netherlands. In addition, all information about how all organizational manners works can be found on the website. Lastly, we created a supportive community for expats which will also help them integrate more easily.</h4>
		
	      <h4><u>Customer Segments</u></h4>
		    <h4>Customers that are interested in our service are expats  who have problems finding accommodation and need help with understanding everything about the organizational manners in the Netherlands. They are people in their early 20s to late 30s and moved to the Netherlands to find work. They are someone who is an open-minded and outgoing person, who is confident and not afraid to take up a new challenge. They normally are very active users of Social Media, especially Instagram and Facebook.</h4>
		
	      <h4><u>Unique value proposition</u></h4>
		    <h4>“Affordable offers for temporary accommodation for expats that not only provide a comfortable place to stay, but also creates a sense of community and support for people who are transitioning to another country”. With this value proposition we are outstanding competitors with the affordable offers for temporary accommodation which are exclusively reserved for expats. Not only will they have a secure place to stay when they arrive in the Netherlands but also are provided with a supportive community that helps them feel at home in their new country.</h4>
		
	      <h4><u>Unfair advantage</u></h4>
		    <h4>As a brand that supports expats, we considered the struggles that they face before coming to a new country. One major one is finding accommodation. We took this problem into account and created a brand which focuses on solving this issue. We are collaborating with hotels in each big city in the Netherlands which make it easier for expats to find a temporary stay until they find a permanent residence. With this collaboration, our customers have 20% off the normal price of the room. Our unique advantage is our collaborations and the arrangement that we have with them. With the discounted price for accommodation, expats will be more willing to book from us than from our competitors (Airbnb, Booking, ect). In addition, we are aware that many expats are facing the problem with organizing their documents while coming to the Netherlands, therefore we provided a full on guide on how everything works related to all organizational manners.</h4>
		
	      <h4><u>Channels</u></h4>
		    <h4>The channels that we are using in order to reach the targeted customers are Instargam, Facebook and our website, BeBold.nl. We use Instagram since it is currently one of the fastest growing social media channels, with several options for small businesses and brands to promote themselves on the market. In addition, Instagram is one of the most used platforms from our target group. The second channel that we want to use is Facebook. This channel would help us to create a community for our customers where they can find useful information and in addition, communicate with other expats. The third channel which we are using is our website. It is the place where consumers may order the product/service online, allowing us to use online direct sales as a distribution method.</h4>
		
	      <h4><u>Key metrics</u></h4>
		    <h4>To make it more realistic for a new brand on the market, our target number to reach currently is: Obtaining 50 followers by April 10th and receiving at least 10 likes every post by April 10th. Remarkably, our social media account met those objectives due to its unique content. This shows that there is interest in our product and mission, which is encouraging because it can only expand.</h4>
		
	      <h4><u>Revenue streams</u></h4>
		    <h4>All of our revenue comes from the commission that we receive every time a room is being booked through our website. We use the commission-based model since we are considered an intermediate who sells the service and at the end we get a percentage of the revenue made by the booking (<em>The 10 Most Popular Startup Revenue Models</em>, n.d.).</h4>
