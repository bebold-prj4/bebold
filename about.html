	<h4> Without a doubt we admit that expats are one of the most adventurous people. In order to experience something fresh and new, they are ready to leave their comfort zones and dive into the unknown. They are not afraid of facing new challenges, from language barriers and cultural differences to being complete alone in a new country. That’s why expats are the embodiment of boldness!</h4>

	<h2 class="font-red"> CONFIDENCE </h2>
	<h4> Becoming an expat can be like jumping into a vast ocean of unknown depths, where the waves of unfamiliarity can toss you around. In such a situation, confidence is the lifeboat that prevents from drowning and keeps you afloat. Keeping the confident attitude helps you navigate through the choppy waters of cultural differences, language barriers and homesickness. It empowers you to take risks, try new things, and embrace the adventure of living in a new place. Without confidence, the expat experience can be like swimming with weights on your ankles. So as an expat remember you keep your chin up and let your confidence be your compass, guiding you to new horizons and unforgettable experiences.</h4>

	<h4> As an expat, it's natural to feel homesick, frustrated, or even overwhelmed at times. But with persistence, you can push through those difficult moments and build a fulfilling life in your new home. Being persistent means not giving up on your goals, even when obstacles arise. It means staying committed to learning the language, making friends, and adapting to new customs and cultural norms. Of course, it may take time and effort to achieve these things, but the rewards are worth it. By persistently working towards your goals, you'll gain a sense of accomplishment and a deeper understanding of your new home. Not only that, but persistence can help you build resilience and adaptability - two essential traits for any expat. When you encounter setbacks or challenges, your persistence will help you bounce back and find new solutions. So, if you're feeling discouraged, remember that persistence is key. Embrace the challenges of expat life, keep working towards your goals, and don't give up on the amazing opportunities that living abroad can offer.</h4>
